| `working_logs/active.md` | Every session start | Work state changes |
| `working_logs/runs/` | Reviewing experiments | After each experiment |
| `registry/` | Looking up scripts/data/outputs | New assets added or modified |
| `notes/` | Plan references or searching prior ideas | Anytime (human observations) |
| `knowledge/` | Plan references or technical questions | Verified new knowledge |
