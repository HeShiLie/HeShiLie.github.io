## For Agent: Execution Protocol

1. Read and follow `docs/agent/always.md`.

2. Based on **User Goal**, fill in:
   - `Agent Refined Plan`
   - `Required Agent Resources`
   - `Acceptance Criteria`

3. To find available Rules, Skills, or Playbooks, check:
   - `docs/registry/agent_system.md`
   - Do not load everything — only what's relevant.

4. When refining:
   - User Goal is the highest source of truth.
   - Do not omit any explicit user requirement.
   - Do not expand scope beyond what was asked.
   - Non-blocking side issues: note them, don't pursue them.
   - If there's ambiguity, danger, or high cost: ask the user first.

5. After implementation and verification, fill in the **Execution Report**.

6. Before user approval:
   - Set status to `awaiting_approval`, not `completed`.
   - Do not archive the plan.
   - Do not describe experimental results as final conclusions.

7. After user approval, complete this **archival checklist** (do not skip):
   - [ ] Update status to `completed`, move to `plans/completed/`.
   - [ ] Update `docs/working_logs/active.md`.
   - [ ] **Register new assets**: new scripts → `registry/scripts.md`; new data/outputs → `registry/outputs.md` or `registry/datasets.md`.
   - [ ] **Register new agent resources**: new rules/skills/playbooks → `registry/agent_system.md`.
   - [ ] If document structure changed, update `docs/README.md`.
   - [ ] If an experiment was run, write a run log to `working_logs/runs/`.
